# advent of code 2024, c++26

To run, use: `make d2 && ./bin/2.out`

if you get compiler incompatibilities, try using [nix direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv). Compiler versions are in `flake.nix`. 

N.B. because of nix, no extra work is taken to add dependencies. That's why there's `gtest` in flake.nix but nothing about it in the Makefile; it's auto added to envvars.
